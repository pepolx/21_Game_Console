# Console Game Project - 21

## Overview

Welcome to the Console Game Project - 21! This is a console-based card game where the goal is to get as close to 21 points as possible without exceeding it. The basic structure of the game has been implemented, including the game logic and card handling. However, the user interface (UI) is a work in progress, and additional functionality related to placing bets needs to be implemented. It was a exercise for me to get into OOP and structurization.

## Features

- **Game Logic**: The core game logic, including dealing cards, shuffling, and determining the winner, has been implemented.

- **Card Handling**: The game includes a decks of cards with appropriate shuffling and dealing mechanisms.

- **Basic UI Structure**: The UI has been started but needs further development to enhance the user experience.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pepolx/21_Game_Console.git

    ```

    Make sure you have .NET installed on your machine.

## To-Do

The following tasks need to be completed to improve the project:

1. **Complete UI Development**: Enhance the user interface to provide a more engaging and interactive experience.

2. **Implement Betting Functionality**: Develop the functionality for players to place bets, adding an extra layer of strategy to the game.
